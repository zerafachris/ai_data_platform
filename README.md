## 4. Data Pipeline Details

The data pipeline is the core of this real-time data engineering system, designed to handle streaming data efficiently from ingestion to processing, storage, and analysis. This section outlines the flow of data through the various stages of the pipeline.

### Data Generation and Ingestion
The data pipeline begins with the generation of data that simulates real-time activities in an online iGaming casino. 

- **Data Generation (Apache Airflow)**:
    - The script `casino_stream.py` generates a continuous stream of data representing customer interactions, game activities, bets placed, and winnings.
    - This data is structured with the following schema:
    ```python
    casino_data = {
        'customer_id': customer_id,
        'activity_datetime': activity_datetime,
        'game_activity': game_activity,
        'game_id': game_id,
        'game_type': game_type,
        'bet_amount': bet_amount,
        'win_amount': win_amount,
        'bonus_amount': bonus_cost_amount
    }
    ```
    - Airflow schedules and manages the execution of this script using DAGs, ensuring a continuous data flow.

- **Data Ingestion (Apache Kafka)**:
    - The generated data is ingested into Kafka, a high-throughput distributed messaging system.
    - Kafka topics are used to organize and categorize the streaming data, ensuring efficient data flow and scalability.
    - Zookeeper manages the Kafka cluster, maintaining configuration information and synchronizing distributed processes.

### Data Processing
Once the data is ingested into Kafka, it needs to be processed and transformed for further analysis.

- **Streaming Data Processing (Faust)**:
    - Faust, a Python stream processing library, processes the real-time data streams from Kafka.
    - It performs transformations, aggregations, and filtering on the data as it flows through the pipeline.
    - The processed data is then published back to Kafka or forwarded to other components for further processing.

- **Batch Processing (Cron Jobs)**:
    - Some data processing tasks are scheduled to run at specific intervals using cron jobs.
    - For example, the `stream_data` function in `casino_stream.py` is triggered by a cron job every 5 seconds to simulate continuous data generation.
    - These cron jobs are managed by Airflow, ensuring timely execution of batch tasks.

### Data Storage
After processing, the data needs to be stored in a way that allows for efficient querying and analysis.

- **ClickHouse**:
    - ClickHouse is used to store the processed data in a columnar format, optimized for analytical queries.
    - It provides real-time data ingestion capabilities from Kafka, ensuring low-latency access to the latest data.
    - Different schemas and materialized views are created in ClickHouse to support various analytical queries and reporting requirements.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
The final stage of the data pipeline involves analyzing and visualizing the data to derive insights and support decision-making.

- **Grafana**:
    - Grafana is used for monitoring and visualizing system metrics and logs.
    - It provides dashboards that help track the performance and health of the data pipeline components.
    - Users can create custom dashboards to visualize specific metrics and gain real-time insights.

- **Apache Superset**:
    - Superset is used for data exploration and creating interactive dashboards.
    - It connects to ClickHouse to run analytical queries and visualize the results.
    - Users can create charts, graphs, and dashboards to explore the data and generate reports.

### Machine Learning Feature Store
To facilitate AI/ML model integration, the system includes a feature store for managing machine learning features.

- **Feast**:
    - Feast is a feature store that provides a centralized repository for storing and serving machine learning features.
    - It ensures consistency between offline training data and online inference data.
    - Features are ingested from the processed data and made available for AI/ML models to use in real-time predictions and personalized recommendations.

### Workflow Orchestration and Integration
- **Node-RED**:
    - Node-RED provides a visual interface for orchestrating and integrating different components of the data pipeline.
    - It allows users to create complex workflows using a drag-and-drop interface, enabling seamless integration between various services.
    - Node-RED can be used to trigger specific actions based on events or conditions, enhancing the flexibility of the data pipeline.

This detailed overview of the data pipeline illustrates how data flows through the system, from generation and ingestion to processing, storage, analysis, and machine learning integration. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the pipeline operates efficiently and effectively, providing real-time insights and supporting intelligent AI systems.
